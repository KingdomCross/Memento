    public String flavor; //The available flavors are Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry and Mimi's Minty
    public String cone; //There is a choice of three cone types: regular, sugar or waffle
    public String[] topping; //There is no limit to the number of toppings. You may use any toppings that you want.
    public int scoop; //This ice cream cone can have unlimited scoops of ice cream -- but only one flavor

    //The major difference here will be that the Memento objects themselves are being stored to a file. Do not create/store an ArrayList as shown in the examples. All of the Memento objects will be stored to the same file
    //Again, you are saving the state of the Ice Cream Cone to the Memento object, not the Ice Cream Cone itself.
